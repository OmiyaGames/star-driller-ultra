Project created in Unity 5.  To run this project, follow these steps:

1) Have Unity 5+ and Blender 2.7+ installed on your computer.
2) Download the entire source code.  If downloaded in zipped form, remember to unzip it.
3) Open Unity, and select the folder the project's source is held.
4) Watch it import.

Bascially, all the models are held in the Blender-only *.blend format, which means that it must be installed for Unity to import them properly.
That said, Blender is free, and doesn't use more than 1GB of hard drive space, so this setup should be pretty cheap to setup.
